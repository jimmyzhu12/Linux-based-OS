You may do with it whatever you want.

BUT IF YOU ARE WORKING ON A COURSE PROJECT OF ANY FORMAT, PLEASE TURN THIS OFF
	IMMEDIATELY! I, ALONG WITH MY GROUP MATES, WILL MOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR
	PLAGIARISM!!! YOU SHOULD WORK ON YOUR OWN, OR PLEASE REFER TO SVGAlib 1.4.3.

Notes from Howie L.:
    Some files are adaptaed from SVGAlib 1.4.3. (See intro for details.)
    This version is used to support S22 MP3 of UIUC ECE 391.
    We are using QEMU. So I am not guaranteeing my implement will work on your
        device correctly or smoothly. (But I hope it does.)
    Also, some variable, function, and/or macro defination may not be used or
        executed at all. LOL.
	-- When doing the vga part, I am inspired by Zikai Liu, Tingkai Liu, Qi Gao,
		and Zhenyu Zong, who made AuroraOS two years ago. Many thanks to their work
		for proving this path can lead us to success.
	-- When designing the gui, I am working on my own.
    If you have any question, please contact hanwenl4 <at> illinois <dot> edu
	
	Please enjoy!
